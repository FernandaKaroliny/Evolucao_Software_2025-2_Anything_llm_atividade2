📦 ESTRATÉGIA DE RELEASE
Resultado principal: Rolling Release (updates are deployed incrementally across servers or users without downtime, replacing old versions progressively)
Confiança: 21.84%

Ranking completo:
 1º Rolling Release (updates are deployed incrementally across servers or users without downtime, replacing old versions progressively) — 21.8%
 2º Scheduled Releases (software is released at predefined time intervals, such as weekly, monthly, or at fixed calendar dates) — 15.6%
 3º Big Bang Release (a large set of features is released simultaneously in a single major deployment event) — 15.5%
 4º Canary Release (a new version is gradually rolled out to a small subset of users to monitor behavior before full deployment) — 13.1%
 5º Continuous Deployment (every code change that passes automated tests is automatically deployed to production without manual approval) — 12.2%
 6º Blue-Green Deployment (two identical production environments are maintained, allowing instant traffic switch between old and new versions) — 12.0%
 7º Continuous Delivery (code is continuously integrated and tested, remaining ready for deployment at any time, but releases require a manual decision) — 9.8%

🔁 FLUXO DE TRABALHO
Resultado principal: GitHub Flow (a lightweight workflow based on a single main branch with short-lived feature branches and pull requests)
Confiança: 24.01%

Ranking completo:
 1º GitHub Flow (a lightweight workflow based on a single main branch with short-lived feature branches and pull requests) — 24.0%
 2º Feature Branch Workflow (each new feature or change is developed in an isolated branch and merged into the main branch after review) — 21.0%
 3º GitLab Flow (extends GitHub Flow by introducing environment-based or release-based branching strategies) — 20.7%
 4º Git Flow (uses multiple long-lived branches such as main, develop, feature, release, and hotfix to manage parallel development and releases) — 18.9%
 5º Trunk-Based Development (developers commit small, frequent changes directly to a shared main branch, relying on feature flags and continuous integration) — 15.4%
